## DISCLAIMERâ€¢

The run.py file is to be used in [faaip's](https://github.com/faaip/) [simplified Emotion-detection-repo] (https://github.com/faaip/Emotion-detection) which is a forked repo from [atulapra's](https://github.com/atulapra) [original Emotion-detection-repo](https://github.com/atulapra/Emotion-detection). 

Follow the faaip's installation process and replace the existing run.py with the one found here. Only minor edits have been made to the original file to output the indices of the emotion_dict[] to the command line.
